# Cookie Cabinet

Cookie Cabinet is a browser extension/add-on that lets you efficiently create, edit and delete cookies for the current tab. Perfect for developing, quickly testing or even manually managing your cookies for your privacy.

Cookie Cabinet is designed to have a modern, minimalist interface that lets you do most standard cookie operations quickly. It is ideal for developing and testing web pages.

You can easily create, edit and delete a cookie for the current page that you are visiting. There is also a handy button to mass delete all the cookies for the current page.

Cookie Cabinet is available for:
- Google Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge
- Opera.

It should be possible to install it on any webkit browser, but keep in mind that only the previous five browsers are officially supported.

Cookie Cabinet is available on mobile devices with an interface optimised for touchscreens:
- Firefox for Android
- Safari for iOS
- Edge for Android and iOS

## Building the Extension

1.  **Install Dependencies:** Run `npm install` or `yarn install` in the project root directory.
2.  **Build for Development:** Run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`. This will start a development server and watch for changes. You can load the `dist` folder as an unpacked extension in your browser.
3.  **Build for Production:** Run `npm run build` or `yarn build`. This will compile and bundle the extension into the `dist` folder. The contents of the `dist` folder can then be zipped and submitted to browser stores.

## Loading Unpacked Extension for Testing

1.  Build the extension using `npm run build`.
2.  Open your browser's extension management page (e.g., `chrome://extensions` for Chrome, `about:debugging` -> "This Firefox" for Firefox).
3.  Enable "Developer mode" or an equivalent setting.
4.  Click "Load unpacked" (Chrome) or "Load Temporary Add-on..." (Firefox) and select the `dist` folder generated by the build process.
